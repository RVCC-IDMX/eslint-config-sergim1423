# Working with ESLint
## Lets learn an ESLint's Rule
When coding in Javascript its important to note that Javascript is a language that doesnt neccessarily need semi colons at the end of statements.
But with that said, its important to note that in order to not get in trouble with the systax, we have to know the rule. Javascript will add semicolons if it feels neccessary.
There are two options to the rule. Called always or never. If we use semicolons in the code we have to always use them throughout. If we never put semicolons then dont use them
in the rest of the code either. Its a simple rule that will save a lot of headache.
